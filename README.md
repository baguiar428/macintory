Script for creating an inventory listing on Macs.

This is a script I created for taking inventory of Macs.
I created it while working as an IT Administrator and I needed to build up an inventory and reference each users equipment.
Hopefully this script will be helpful to someone else who needs it for similiar functionality.

Please check comments in the script for more information, until I am able to update/better format this README.
Cheers.
